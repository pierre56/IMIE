Politicians were arguing over peace treaties and the question of America's entry into the League of Nations. Overseas there were wars and revolutions. At home, 1919 was marked by major strikes, and large race riots in Chicago and other cities. Terrorist attacks on Wall Street produced fears of radicals and terrorists. Harding virtually ignored Cox and essentially campaigned against Wilson, calling for a return to ""normalcy""; with an almost 4-to-1 spending advantage, he won a landslide victory.
